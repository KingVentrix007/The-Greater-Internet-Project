I want to make an alternative for https, for people running server on http.
Ill call it httpe, http encrypted 


Connection plan:


Client requests rsa public key from server
Server sends rsa-key + coustem cert
Client validates cert
if valid:
client creates RSA key pair, temp aes
client sends username+password encrypted with AES key. it also sends the AES key encrypted with the server public key, and sends its own rsa-public key

server checks username+password, after decrypted AES key and decypted username+password:

if valid:
server creates token+temp aes
server encrypts token with temp aes, then encryptes aes with client public key
server sends encypted data back to client
server attches cleint token and temp aes togther for 10minutes

cleint take token
decrypts token.

client then re-encypts token with server aes-key and sends it back to confirm Connection, and sends a NEW RSA-public key

server takes confirmation

server now removes old aes key from token, and creates a new one and accostites it on its side as well as the RSA public key.

server then returns a new AES key, ecnypted with rsa-public key.

client then requets data from server using aes key to encrpt requetsts, send with the token encypted as well.
server decodes token, confirms it, and returns data also encypted with that aes key

comifncaiton conutes like this for 30 minuteis befreo token expires.
